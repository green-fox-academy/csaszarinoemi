    <h2> Fullstack software developer </h2>
    <p> I love to have an overall knowlage of things work. That's why I love fullstack. My main goal is, to improve myself as a developer</p>
    <p>That's why I applied to Greenfox. I hope I will learn the basics here, and I will be able to improve on my own.</p>
